# Description
Shell scripts lists and delete all inactive remote branches by using "--since" syntax (see git log)

# Usage
    sh git-list-inactive-remote-branch.sh "30 days ago" > inactive-branch
    sh git-rm-remote-branch.sh inactive-branch

# Note
 - NO TEST
 - We only print out the git push command (no execute it), so it doesn't hurt.
